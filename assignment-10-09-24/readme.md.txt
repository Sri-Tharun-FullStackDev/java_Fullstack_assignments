Here is a list of potential lab exercises that can help you practice TypeScript concepts:

---

### *1. TypeScript Basics*
*Objective*: Familiarize yourself with basic TypeScript syntax (types, functions, and variables).
- *Exercise 1*: Create a function that accepts a number array and returns the sum.
- *Exercise 2*: Create an interface for a User object and implement a function that prints user details.

---

### *2. Classes and Interfaces*
*Objective*: Work with classes and interfaces in TypeScript.
- *Exercise 1*: Define an interface Vehicle with properties such as make, model, and year. Create a class Car that implements the interface.
- *Exercise 2*: Create a class Employee with properties like name, age, salary, and methods to get and update employee details.

---

### *3. Generics*
*Objective*: Understand generics and how they enhance code reusability.
- *Exercise 1*: Create a generic class Stack<T> that implements push, pop, and peek operations.
- *Exercise 2*: Create a generic function reverseArray<T>(arr: T[]): T[] that reverses an array of any type.

---

### *4. TypeScript Enums*
*Objective*: Learn to use enums for predefined sets of constants.
- *Exercise 1*: Create an enum OrderStatus with values like Pending, Shipped, Delivered, and Cancelled. Use it in a function that changes the status of an order.
  
---

### *5. Union Types and Type Guards*
*Objective*: Handle multiple types in a function using union types.
- *Exercise 1*: Create a function format(input: string | number): string that takes either a string or a number and formats it as a string.
- *Exercise 2*: Write a type guard function that checks if a variable is of type number or string.

---

### *6. Advanced Types*
*Objective*: Understand advanced types like intersection, mapped, and conditional types.
- *Exercise 1*: Create an intersection type Employee & Manager and write a function that accepts both roles.
- *Exercise 2*: Use conditional types to create a utility type that converts all properties of an object to string.

---

### *7. Modules and Namespaces*
*Objective*: Organize code into modules and namespaces.
- *Exercise 1*: Create a module math.ts with functions for basic arithmetic operations. Import and use it in another file.
- *Exercise 2*: Create a namespace Utilities and define multiple utility functions. Use them in your program.

---

### *8. Error Handling and Exceptions*
*Objective*: Handle errors and exceptions in TypeScript.
- *Exercise 1*: Create a function that reads a number from user input. Throw an error if the input is not a valid number.
- *Exercise 2*: Use a try-catch block to handle exceptions in a file read operation (simulated).

---

### *9. TypeScript with Node.js*
*Objective*: Create a basic Node.js application using TypeScript.
- *Exercise 1*: Build a small API that fetches and returns data about books using Express and TypeScript.
- *Exercise 2*: Create a CLI tool in TypeScript that interacts with a file system (e.g., reading and writing JSON files).

---

### *10. Testing in TypeScript*
*Objective*: Write unit tests for TypeScript code.
- *Exercise 1*: Install Jest and write tests for a function that calculates the area of a circle.
- *Exercise 2*: Test a Stack class by writing test cases for push, pop, and peek methods.
